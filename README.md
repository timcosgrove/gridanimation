# Animation backdrop for glass
I made this piece of stained glass:
![Grid window](readme-src/IMG_20170315_211141.jpg)

It is sized to fit a specific computer monitor approximately 24" diagonally, with the intention of running animation onscreen that is sized and shaped to the pieces of glass and the lead lines that make up the window.
